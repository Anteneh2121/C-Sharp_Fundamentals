**Valid_Number**
`- Write a program and ask the user to enter a number. The number should be between 1 to 10. If the user enters a valid number, display "Valid" on the console. Otherwise, display "Invalid". (This logic is used a lot in applications where values entered into input boxes need to be validated.)`

**Max_Two**
`2- Write a program which takes two numbers from the console and displays the maximum of the two.`

**Image**
`3- Write a program and ask the user to enter the width and height of an image. Then tell if the image is landscape or portrait.`
